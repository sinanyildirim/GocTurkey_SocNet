# GocTurkey_SocNet
This repo contains the dataset and the code that generates the results reported in the paper entitled
"A model of dynamic migration networks: Explaining Turkey's inter-provincial migration flows"

The script "main_migration.m" runs the experiments for three different models.

1) The Multinomial logistic regression model, where the migration probabilities are directly modelled by a regression function.
2) The Dirichlet-multinomial model with a non-hierarchical specification, where the migration probabilities have Dirichlet distributions, whose parameters are determined by a regression function. 
This variant has a single intercept and a time slope parameter. 
3) The Dirichlet-multinomial  model with a hierarchical specification, where the migration probabilities have Dirichlet distributions, whose parameters are determined by a regression function. 
This variant has a distict intercept and a time slope parameter for each province; those parameters are themselves random, following the same distributions for all provinces.

Details for those models can be found in the paper.

For the three models explained, the following functions are used respectively:
1) MCMC_ML_Reg_Migr
2) MCMC_DM_Reg_Migr
3) MCMC_DM_Reg_Migr_hier

All those functions implement a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs algorithm that is crafted suitably to the corresponding model.

The data are contained in the files in the directory "Inputfies". The main script automatically imports them suitably.

The outputs are some figures, showing trace plots, histograms, box plots, etc. obtained from the samples generated by the MCMC algorithms. Those figures are saved as eps files in a directory whose name can be specified by the user at the top of the main script "main_migration.m".

The main script "main_migration.m" has also the other parameters that help the user select 
- the models to be investigated,
- the number of iterations, burn-in times,
- factors to be included in the regression functions
- etc.
